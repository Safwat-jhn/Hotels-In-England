# Hotels-In-England
This project aims to extract comprehensive data on operational hotels in England, Wales, and Scotland. The data to be collected includes hotel names, full addresses, websites, contact information, star ratings, and prices (if available). The extracted results will then be exported to an Excel spreadsheet for easy analysis and use.
